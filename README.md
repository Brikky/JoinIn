#Project 1: Joinin
####Created by Lynette Dur√°n & Brandon Kerr
A Social app that allows users to share Blurbs with each other based on location.

Technologies Used
-----------
* HTML
* CSS
* Bootstrap
* Javascript
* jQuery

##Use:
![home page](http://i.imgur.com/0begHmN.png "Home Page")
![city main page](http://i.imgur.com/9fS5mUm.png "City Main Page")

Upon visiting the app, users encounter the home screen which displays all supported cities, and each citie's most recent blurb.

Clicking on a city name takes the user to that city's index page, where all blurbs are displayed. From this page users can create, delete, and +1 Blurbs. 

##Triumps
* Designing mobile-first
* Completing all server routes successfully
* Learning more advanced Git features
* Designing our own graphics

##Challenges
* Dealing with overriding Bootstrap
* Time management
* Prioritizing features
* Github conflicts

##Advice
* Prioritize goals early, stay focused on what's most important, what as the biggest impact/implementation time ratio
* Reference trello/wireframes early, focusing on getting out the initial product then work on refinements because they'll never end

##Code Examples

```JavaScript
app.post('/api/cities/:id/blurbs', function blurbsCreate(req, res) {
  var cityId = req.params.id;
  var newBlurb = new db.Blurb({
    poster: req.body.poster,
    textContent: req.body.textContent,
    likes: 0,
    imgPath: req.body.imgPath || ""
  });
  db.City.findOne({
    _id: cityId
  },
    function(err, city) {
      city.blurbs.unshift(newBlurb);
      city.save();
    }
  );
  res.json(newBlurb);
});
```

```Javascript
app.delete('/api/cities/:id/blurbs/:blurbId', function deleteBlurb(req, res) {
  var blurbId = req.params.blurbId;
  var cityId = req.params.id;

  db.City.findOne({
    _id: cityId
  }, 
    function(err, city) {
      city.blurbs = city.blurbs.filter(function(blurb) {
        return blurb._id != blurbId;
      });
      city.save();
    }
  );
  res.send(blurbId);
});
```
